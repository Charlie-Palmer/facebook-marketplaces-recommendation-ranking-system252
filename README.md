## Project Description
Facebook Marketplace is a platform for buying and selling products on Facebook. 
The main reason it is so popular is it's recommendation ranking system which uses AI to recommend the most relevant listings based on a personalised search query.

This project aims to recreate this system to perform the same functionality, utilizing AI to enhance the user experience by recommending relevant listings based on the user search query. 

We started by taking a dataset of two csv files and a folder of images corresponding to the products in the dataset from an AWS EC2 instance. This dataset will be used to train our model.
